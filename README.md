<h5>User Stories</h5>

I am an interior architect (35), and I am designing the family suites of a hotel. As I need wooden furniture to decorate the living area of the suites, I am looking for a trustable supplier to provide range-selling of wooden hand-made products.

- As I don’t have time to check the shops, I prefer online shopping. I think there are better options for better prices online. 

- I am looking for something elegant, luxury and high-quality with the best price.  

- As I will never see the product until I receive it, I need to make sure I am buying the best product. I would like to see the customer reviews; not just only the positive ones, but also I need the negative feedback to make my decision

- I don’t have time to check everything on a website. I would like to use the search bar efficiently and be directed to what I am actually looking for. 

- When I am working, I don’t like to get distracted with the ads, pop-outs or be directed to anywhere else. I want to be straight-forward in this process. 

- As the hotel management gave me a limited budget, I want the ability to know price divisions, (delivery fee, taxes etc) clearly to know how much I will pay in total.  Also be informed if there are any discounts, or special offers.

- I would like to sort the products in order, to see how they compare to each other (price, rating)

- I would like to see an insight under the product to be informed about product sizes, the material, etc. presented with the clear pictures.

- I need to know the estimated delivery time so that I can set up a deadline and present my schedule to the hotel management. 

- The ability of being in touch with the seller any time I need to be. Contact details should be reachable on the website.

- I don’t want to lose time by entering unnecessary data on the registration process, it should be as quick as possible. If there is an error, I need to know the error to save time and proceed. 

- I don’t want to lose time by long readings, I am looking for more info, with less reading.

- I am looking for a trustable companion as I am shopping on behalf of my client. I would like to be communicated clearly by the company. All the information presented should be open and humble. 

- I want to check my previous purchases too, to set up a clear design target. When I need to, I’d like to log in easily again. 


<h5>Design Choices</h5>

The main goal of the design is to create a smooth user experience. The following design choices are made with this in mind;

<h6>Font</h6>
“Playfair display, serif” was used in order to relate it with the brand’s logo. It is a simple font, easy to navigate. 

<h6>Icons</h6>
All icons were simple and common e-commerce website icons to avoid any confusions or frustrations. Users will rely on their previous e-commerce experiences. 

<h6>Colors</h6>
In order to relate it with the product, wooden color (#966F33) is used. Other main colors are black&white, the idea behind this is to provide a simple navigation experience with no eye-frustration. 

<h6>Styling</h6>
Feeling of trust, elegance and simplicity were highlighted in styling. 

<h6>Background</h6>
As it is common for e-commerce websites, the background is white. The idea behind was again, to highlight the products, making customers to only focus on product info, without any distractions.

<h3>Bugs discovered</h3>
    <h4>Solved Bugs</h4>

        - Begining of the project I faced with cache bug and I couldn't activate css. Eventhough my mentor and tutors has helped me out a lot to solve that bug, it hasn't been sorted yet so I have to copy the link 
        on by browser and paste it to incognito to see changings on front-end.
        - I couldn't deploy my project on Github  for that reason I deleted the local repo and created the new one by using;
            * echo "# babayani-final-project" >> README.md
            * git init
            * git add README.md
            * git commit -m "first commit"
            * git remote add origin https://github.com/kaanistemi/babayani-final-project
            * git push -u origin master


   <h4>Unsolved Bugs</h4>
        -Even tought I've implemented same steps several times with video to activate e-mail, I couldn't fix it and as that was Christmas and New year time, I couldn't reach Tutor Support.
